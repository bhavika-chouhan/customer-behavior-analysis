# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer transactional data to understand purchasing behavior, identify high-value customers, and provide actionable insights for business decisions. The analysis follows an end-to-end workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Business Problem
Businesses often need to answer questions such as:
- Which customers contribute the most to revenue?
- How does repeat purchase behavior impact sales?
- What is the effect of discounts on customer spending?
- How can customer behavior insights improve business strategy?

## Tools Used
- **Python** – Data cleaning and preparation  
- **SQL** – Data analysis and querying  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and visualization  

## Dataset
- Contains customer-level transaction data including customer IDs, purchase amounts, product details, discount usage, subscription status, shipping type, previous purchases, age group, and gender.  
- No predefined customer segments were provided; segments were created based on purchasing behavior (previous purchases).  

## Key Analysis & Insights
- Customers with frequent purchases and higher total spending generate most of the revenue.  
- Repeat customers spend more on average than one-time buyers.  
- Certain products receive high discounts but still generate significant revenue.  
- Age and gender affect customer spending patterns.  
- Customers were grouped into **New, Returning, and Loyal** based on the number of previous purchases.

## Dashboard & Visualizations
- Power BI dashboards visualize revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and subscription trends.
